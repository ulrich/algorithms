## My linked list
Implementation of linked list.

## Hash table
Implementation of hash table.

## Factorial
Implement the factorial algorithm with recursion.

## ArrayPairSum (AD)
Given an integer array, output all pairs that sum up to a specific value k.

## LinearSearch (ANB)
Implementation of linear search simple algorithm.

## OptimizedLinearSearch (ANB)
Implemention of an optimized linear search with sentinel.

## IsUnique (CCI)
Determine if a string has all unique characters.

## Anagram (CCI)
This is a simple implementation of anagram searcher. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

## URLify (CCI)
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)

## Palindrome (CCI)
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

## OneWay (CCI)
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
